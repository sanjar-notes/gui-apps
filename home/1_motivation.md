# 1. Motivation

GUIs are an important aspect of computing, or access to it. I consider GUIs/apps a tool, and not something that should be dedicated all my time/energy to.
And it's sad for me to see various aspect of GUIs, viz:
1. Web apps
2. Desktop apps
3. Mobile apps
4. Other device apps

As completely different things.

I wish to learn the basics of GUI development, including how to do computation on the backend effectively.

After knowing how to do various kinds of computations in different architectures, I can spend my time thinking about the computation/business aspect, intead on the app, which is the right thing to do, according to me.

This repo is therefore a simple effort to study and implement various GUIs, and their architectures.

Hopefully, after understanding this within 2 years, I can then think intuitively about producing any software that I require, of course after working on the computation research.
